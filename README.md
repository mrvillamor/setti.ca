Making a "coming soon" landing page.

# notes
I decided on using Bootstrap 4 as my website's framework for its flexibility and (I know it's shallow) its popularity. I'm taking a Bootstrap 4 Essential Training course by Ray Villalobos at Lynda.com. So far, I've made a simple landing page with my logo, my website name and a "coming soon" tagline.

I'll probably take a full on "Become a front-end web developer" learning path at Lynda so I can address the issues below which I don't think have been answered in Villalobos' course.

# TODO
I want the logo to be placed at 15% of the viewport's height. It seems to be working on my laptop's browser (MS Edge), but not on my iPhone5S (Safari). I must not be using the proper syntax.

Completely center all text even in the sm breakpoint. Left-align on a small screen doesn't look good.

Create a bigger logo so it could look crisp no matter what the screen sizes are.
